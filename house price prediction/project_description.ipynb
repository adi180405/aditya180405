    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict the selling price of a house based on various features such as its area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. Using a machine learning regression model, the system learns patterns from historical housing data and estimates property prices for new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project integrates a Flask web application that allows users to input house details through a simple form and instantly view the predicted price."
